### using pike to present  a html file

```java
#!/usr/bin/env pike

// Load required modules
int main() {
    // Import the modules
    Stdio.File html_file = Stdio.File("/path/to/your/file.html", "r");

    // Set the HTTP headers
    Protocols.HTTP.Query response = Protocols.HTTP.Query();
    response->set_header("Content-Type", "text/html");

    // Read the HTML content from the file
    string html_content = html_file->read(-1);

    // Set the response content
    response->set_content(html_content);

    // Print the HTTP response
    write(response->format());

    return 0;
}

```
that's how you would present a HTML file with pike, pike has a small history for creating dynamic web applications... the practice of using the code above is not common or encouraged but it shows how powerful pike can be.
