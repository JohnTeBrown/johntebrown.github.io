# PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)
PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a technology in PowerShell that enables the declarative configuration of systems. With DSC, you can specify the desired state of a system, and DSC will automatically bring the system into that state, ensuring consistency and compliance.
## Getting Started
To get started with DSC, you need to have PowerShell 4.0 or later installed on your system. DSC configurations are written in PowerShell scripts and typically consist of the following components:
1. **Configuration**: The configuration script that defines the desired state of a system.
2. **Resources**: PowerShell modules that contain DSC resources, which are used to manage various aspects of the system.
3. **Nodes**: The target systems on which you want to apply the configuration.
## Creating a DSC Configuration
Here's an example of a simple DSC configuration to ensure that the IIS web server is installed and running:
```powershell
configuration WebServerConfig {
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    Node localhost {
        WindowsFeature IIS {
            Name = "Web-Server"
            Ensure = "Present"
        }

        Service IIS {
            Name = "W3SVC"
            State = "Running"
            DependsOn = "[WindowsFeature]IIS"
        }
    }
}
```
`WebServerConfig -OutputPath "C:\DSCConfigs"`
## Applying a DSC Configuration
Once you have defined a DSC configuration, you can apply it to a target system using the Start-DscConfiguration cmdlet. For example:
```powershell
Start-DscConfiguration -Path "C:\DSCConfigs" -Wait -Verbose
```
This will apply the configuration on the local system and ensure that the IIS web server is installed and running.
## Monitoring and Troubleshooting
To monitor the status of DSC configurations and troubleshoot any issues, you can use the Get-DscConfigurationStatus cmdlet:
```powershell
Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```
Additionally, you can view the DSC logs located in the `C:\Windows\System32\Configuration\`
directory for more detailed information.
## Conclusion
PowerShell DSC is a powerful tool for managing and configuring systems in a consistent and automated manner. It allows you to define and enforce the desired state of your systems, making it easier to maintain and manage your infrastructure.
