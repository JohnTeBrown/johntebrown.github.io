# VPS vs Static website generators

this is a complex topic that has a lot of turns and the simple response from most will be "it depends on your needs"

but the more advanced response will contain questions based on what your using, budget what your trying to do and what your using to build the application that needs hosted

## static website generators

static generators provide easy and simple ways to host your site on a domain, a decent amount of webhosts are static site generators like the one your viewing your viewing this article on, static site generatos cannot display anything else other than vanilla html and css, they don't provide serverside access meaning Node.Js won't work.. this limits how flexable your website can be.

## VPS's

VPS provide serverside access
and can be used to do the same things static website generators do, serverside access is such a big deal because it allows for the usage of more advanced tools like Node.JS ruby with Ruby On Rails and Flask or Django with python and much more, it also allows for the usage  of more advanced managment tools such as using admin panels like Plesk or Cpanel.

VPS overall offer much more than standard static site generators.
